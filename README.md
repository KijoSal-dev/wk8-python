# COVID-19 Cases and Vaccination Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries using time-series data. It includes visualizations (line, bar, and pie charts), calculations (e.g., death rate), and a narrative summary of key insights. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, addressing data challenges like missing values and column name errors (e.g., `KeyError` for `'location'`).

## Objectives
- **Visualize Trends**:
  - Plot total cases, deaths, and daily new cases over time (line charts).
  - Plot cumulative vaccinations and percentage of population vaccinated (line and bar charts).
  - Create pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.
  - Plot top countries by total cases (bar chart).
- **Calculate Metrics**:
  - Compute death rate (`total_deaths / total_cases`) for selected countries.
- **Summarize Findings**:
  - Identify 3-5 key insights (e.g., fastest vaccine rollout, highest death rate).
  - Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.
- **Deliverable**:
  --**A well-documented Jupyter Notebook having:**
  - covid_analysis.ipynb as well as pdf for narrtive explanation.
  - wk8.ipynb for code, visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3**: Core programming language.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Creating line, bar, and pie charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code, visualizations, and markdown narrative.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting (assumed for this project).
